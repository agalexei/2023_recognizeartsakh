            the great writers of antiquity such as Strabo, Claudius Ptolemy,
            Cassius Dio, Pliny the Elder, and Plutarch, Artsakh was unified into a single Armenian state by
            King Artashes the Pious (Hellenized as King Artaxias I, r. 189-160 BC) sometime in the mid-2nd
            century BC. However, it wasn’t until a century later, under the reign of legendary King Tigran the
            Great (Hellenized as King Tigranes the Great, r. 95-55 BC), that the whole Armenian realm was
            fully centralized. At this time, it was known as the province of Artsakh and included 12 districts.
            <br><br>
            Following the official conversion of Armenia to Christianity in 301 AD, becoming the first state to do so,
            Armenia
            angered the historic imperialist power in the region. The country was ultimately partitioned in a
            Roman-sponsored treaty in 384/7, and Artsakh was given to Aghvank, a vassal state of Persia, as a prize for
            helping them out in their
            war against Armenia.
            <br><br>
            Nonetheless, Artsakh continued as an early center for Christianity. It is from here where
            Armenian theologian Saint Mesrop Mashtots (362-440), with sponsorship from Armenian
            Catholicos Sahak the Great (354-439), opened one of the first schools to teach the Armenian
            alphabet he designed at the Monastery of Amaras.
            <br><br>
            Eventually, Sassanid Armenia was fully annexed by 428, and it stayed a part of Persia
            until the Arab-Islamic invasions of the mid-7th century. The Arabs reunited Armenia under their
            suzerainty as the Ariminiya province. However, Armenia once again attained independence
            under the Bagratuni dynasty in the late 9th century, around the time when the construction of the
            Dadivank Monastery began, though much of the current complex was built over the next few
            centuries. Dadivank is a prime example of the Armenian architectural heritage in Artsakh.

          <div id="w-node-d7033d9c-2aa1-ac4a-53af-bac54a062354-d046cae2" class="heading-regular">This was especially
            true
            in Artsakh, where the native Khachen dynasty had exceptional self-governance beginning in the
            early 11th century. After the Seljuk Turkic invasions of Armenia that ended Bagratuni Armenia in
            1045, the Khachen dynasty survived relatively unharmed as the Kingdom of Artsakh, having
            control of most of what is today the Republic of Artsakh and the Armenian province of Syunik.
            The dynasty worked with the Georgian-Zakarids during a brief period of Armenian revivalism
            that liberated the highlands from Seljuk occupation in the late 12th and early 13th centuries.
            Following Mongol occupation, Artsakh became a vassal state and retained much of its internal
            autonomy.<br><br>
            During this period, the Artsakh Kingdom was ruled by a great Khachen leader with the
            name of King Hasan-Jalal Dawla I (r. 1214-1261/2), who took on an Arabic name as a show of
            wealth and prominence. Artsakh entered its own golden age through his political shrewdness
            and benevolent rule.
            <br><br>
            King Hasan-Jalal I himself was descended from both the Khachen and the
            Zakarids, and he married into the royal family of Syunik.
            <br><br>
            However, he would become Artsakh’s last king because, due to his eminence as a
            wealthy Christian leader with significant autonomy, he was the source of contempt among local
            Muslim rulers, who eventually had him arrested, tortured, and martyred. The Kingdom of
            Artsakh was demoted to that of a much smaller princely domain known as the Khachen
            Principality.
            <br><br>
            At this point, the ancient region of Artsakh became more commonly referred to as
            Karabakh, meaning “Black Garden,” with a mixed Turkic-Persian etymology. It refers to the
            triangular region between the Hagari (Hekeri), Araks (Aras), and Kur (Kura) rivers, with the
            eastern steppes known as Lower Karabakh and the western mountains as Upper or
            Nagorno-Karabakh.
            <br><br>
            in 1603, the Shah of Safavid Persia, Abbas I (r. 1588-1629), recognized each
            governor of the Khachen Principality as an individual prince, breaking it up into five separate
            Armenian polities known as the Khamsa (Five in Arabic) Melikates. They were the Melikates of
            Gyulistan (north of Nagorno-Karabakh; part of the Shahumyan region), Jaraberd (northern
            Nagorno-Karabakh), Khachen (central Nagorno-Karabakh), Dizak (southern
            Nagorno-Karabakh), and Varanda (southeastern Nagorno-Karabakh).

            authority left the northern
            Armenian regions open to invasion and plunder by Caucasus Muslim tribes. During the chaos,
            the Armenians launched a liberation war of self-defense led by Davit Bek of Syunik (d. 1728)
            and Avan Yuzbashi of Karabakh (c. 1670-1735), which temporarily united the Armenian
            melikates. The resistance was spiritually led by Yesayi Hasan-Jalalyan (1677-1728), the
            Catholicos of Gandzasar. Initially a peasant uprising because of Islamic misrule, the melikates
            would later coordinate with local Muslim rulers when the far worse Ottoman Empire invaded
            Persia’s northern and western territories in 1723.<br><br>
            The Armenian forces drove the Ottomans out
            of their homeland and the new Persian king, Nadir Shah Afshar (r. 1736-1747), granted the
            Armenians of Syunik and Karabakh much-desired self-rule, promoting the leaders of the
            resistance to positions of governorship and celebrating them for their valor. To the great benefit
            of the Armenians, Nadir Shah even deported many of the Turkic aristocrats and landlords of
            Karabakh and their families to Khorasan for opposing his rule.
            <br><br>
            After the conspiracy that assassinated Nadir Shah, a member of one of the tribes of
            Turkic aristocrats, Penah Ali Khan Javanshir (r. 1748-1759), took advantage of the situation and
            organised his cavalry to loot and wage war across Karabakh in 1748. Pitting the different
            melikates against one another, he and his son conquered each of the autonomous Armenian
            polities, centralizing his rule with violence that caused many Armenians to leave the highlands.
            He founded Penahabad as the capital of the now Karabakh Khanate on the site of the Armenian
            Shosh Fortress, originally built by Avan Yuzbashi. The city would later come to be known as
            Shushi, today the cultural capital of Karabakh. The Qajar dynasty ultimately came to power in
            Persia and subjugated the Karabakh Khanate as a vassal state in 1795 and again in 1797.
            <br><br>
            By the beginning of the 19th century, Russia had conquered most of the south
            Caucasus. In 1805, Ibrahim Khalil Khan Javanshir (r. 1759-1806), son and successor of Penah
            Ali, signed the Treaty of Kurekchay, declaring the Karabakh Khanate a vassal state of the
            Russians. However, he was dethroned and killed by the Russian military the next year, and the
            Khanate was abolished in 1822, fully integrating it into the Russian Empire. Over the following
            decades, many Armenians who had left Karabakh during the despotic rule of the Javanshir
            dynasty returned back to the highlands. It was around this period when some of the most
            famous Armenian churches of Shushi were built, such as the Green Chapel (1818) and the
            Ghazanchetsots Cathedral (1888). Karabakh would eventually be included in the Elisavetpol
            governorate.

            month, it broke apart into the three Caucasian states we know today: Georgia, Armenia, and
            Azerbaijan. Ultimately, it was Azerbaijan that laid claim over the Karabakh Highlands, which the
            Armenians found unacceptable, given their experience with Turkic rulership. On 27 July 1918,
            the people of Karabakh declared the independent Karabakh Council, led by Prime Minister
            Yeghishe Ishkhanyan (1886-1975). The Ottomans used the opportunity of the collapsing
            Russian Empire to invade the Caucasus with the aid of Azerbaijan, where they massacred up to
            30,000 Armenians in Baku that September. To avoid a similar fate, the Karabakh Council
            conceded to the ultimatum to submit, and the Turkish military marched into Shushi in October.
            Popular resistance sprang up across Nagorno-Karabakh, however. By early November, World
            War One had ended, and the Ottomans were forced to retreat from the Caucasus, leaving
            Azerbaijan to deal with the armed revolutionaries of Karabakh.<br><br>
            The Prime Minister of Azerbaijan at the time, Fatali Khan Khoyski (1875-1920), enlisted
            the aid of British Major General William Montgomerie Thomson (1877-1963) to bring Karabakh
            under the dominion of Azerbaijan in exchange for Baku’s oil. Minister of Defense Khosrov bey
            Sultanov (1879-1943), an avid Turkic nationalist and a landowner in Karabakh, was appointed
            Governor-General of the region and arrived in Shushi with a British military escort in January
            1919, in spite of the fact that the Karabakh Council had proclaimed itself a fundamental part of
            the Republic of Armenia at this time. The British declared that any action against Sultanov
            would be regarded as an action against the British Empire.
            <br><br>
            Despite this, there was still
            resistance, which Azerbaijan and the British Empire attempted to squash with military brutality.
            Calling for reinforcements, Khosrov recruited his brother, Sultan bey Sultanov (1871-1942), a
            chief of nearly 2,000 mounted Turkic-Kurdish cavalry irregulars, to intervene. In June, his bandit
            army massacred 600-700 Armenian civilians in several villages surrounding Shushi, such as
            Khaibalikend (Ghaybalishen), Jamilli, Karkijahan, and Pahlul.
            <br><br>
            By the end of summer, the Karabakh Council had recognized that further resistance was
            fruitless and held a conference with Khosrov bey Sultanov between 13-22 August 1919,
            temporarily conceding to Azerbaijan on several conditions, including that the Paris Peace
            Conference would determine Karabakh’s final status. Sultanov agreed, and the British withdrew
            their forces. However, Azerbaijan would routinely violate its conditions, and by March 1920,
            Sultanov had ordered his military regiments to disarm the Armenians of Shushi, which was the
            spark to another armed resistance. As a result of the rebellion, Azerbaijani soldiers and rioters
            began looting the Armenian market and stores, and a general massacre of Armenian civilians
            ensued. Various Armenian political, economic, and religious leaders were dragged out of their
            homes and lynched. The main priest of Shushi, Bishop Vahan, had his tongue torn out before
            his head was chopped off and paraded through the streets on a pike.
            <br><br>
            The entire Armenian
            district of Shushi, including residential buildings, was lit on fire, destroying up to 2,000 buildings.
            Only 10-15 houses remained. The burning was so severe, Shushi was dubbed Armenia’s
            Pompeii. 20,000 Armenians ended up killed or exiled from the city. Throughout late March and
            April, the Azerbaijani Army also massacred or exiled up to 10,000 additional Armenians across
            the rest of Karabakh, including destroying more than 30 villages and towns.<br><br>
            In late April 1920, Azerbaijani communists, with the backing of the Red Army, declared
            the Azerbaijan Revolutionary Committee (Azrevkom), and the Soviets entered Shushi on 12
            May. Though the violence had been put to an end, the old animosities between the Armenians
            and Azerbaijanis continued, now just through a Bolshevik framework. For example, two
            competing Revkoms were declared in the region. One, the Karabakh Revkom, was proclaimed
            out of Shushi by Azerbaijani Bahadir Valibayov (1894-1937), who was appointed from Baku.
            Another, the Nagorno-Karabakh Revkom, was declared out of a smaller village south of Shushi
            named Taghavard by the Armenian Bolshevik Sako Hambardzumyan (1870-1944). The
            difference in the naming is relevant. Karabakh refers to both mountainous and lowland
            Karabakh, which, together, had a Turkic majority, while Nagorno-Karabakh refers to just
            mountainous Karabakh, which had an Armenian majority. This would be a source of dispute
            during the early Soviet period. Ultimately, both Revkoms were merged by June, and Sako was
            made head of the party in Shushi as compensation. However, this balance would not be kept in
            place by the Azerbaijani leaders in Baku, who later ordered the Karabakh Revkom abolished in
            August and Sako replaced in October, fully integrating Karabakh into Azerbaijan, led at this time
            by Nariman Narimanov (1870-1925).
            <br><br>
            This and other local mishandlings of the Caucasus sparked the interest of the Soviet
            Central Committee (CC), which intervened through the creation of the Caucasus Bureau
            (Kavburo), led by Sergo Ordzhonikidze (1886-1937) and Sergei Kirov (1886-1934), two
            highly-reputable Bolsheviks. On 3 June 1921, the Kavburo agreed that mountainous Karabakh
            should be part of Armenia and threatened Narimanov to immediately comply. As a result,
            Narimanov gathered the Azerbaijani Political Bureau (Azpolitburo) and declared Karabakh a
            part of Azerbaijan on 26 June, defying the decision of the CC, and prompting yet another
            Kavburo meeting to decide this once and for all. On July 4, 1921, the seven members met
            together: Kirov, Ordzhonikidze, Narimanov, Filipp Makharadze (chairman of the Georgian
            Revkom, 1868-1941), Amayak Nazaretian (1889-1937), Gavril Myasnikov (a left-communist,
            1889-1945), and Yuri Figatner (1889-1937). On the vote to leave Karabakh in Azerbaijan, it was
            opposed 4-3, with Kirov, Ordzhonikidze, Myasnikov, and Figatner in opposition to the proposal.
            On the vote to include Nagorno-Karabakh in Armenia, it was voted in favor, 4-3. The Kavburo
            reaffirmed their 3 June declaration.
            <br><br>
            However, the next day, due to perplexing circumstances, the Kavburo rescinded their
            vote and decided to leave Karabakh in Azerbaijan. It is officially unclear what situation brought
            about this development. However, Alexandr Myasnikyan (1886-1925), leader of the Armenian
            SSR at this time, reported that Narimanov had declared that, if the decision had gone through,
            then Azerbaijan would not send its supply of kerosene to the other republics. This threat, along
            with Narimanov’s cleverly stubborn bureaucratic maneuvers and the half-hearted dedication of
            Armenian Bolsheviks, ultimately brought the Kavburo to heel. In the next couple of years, the
            political status of Karabakh and its delimitation was discussed, and finally, the
            Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) was proclaimed on 7 July 1923. A new capital
            was founded near Shushi named Stepanakert, meant to replace the Armenian Quarter
            destroyed during the Shushi Massacre of 1920.
            <br><br>
            In the following decades, most of the distinguished leaders of Azerbaijan who were
            involved in the settlement of the question of Karabakh, including figures like Narimanov,
            Valibayov (who would go on to hold many high positions in Azerbaijan, such as its
            Prosector-General from 1936-37), as well as Dadash Bunyadzade (originally the Commissar
            Extraordinary of Karabakh, later leader of Azerbaijan’s Sovnarkom in the early 30s, 1888-1938)
            were condemned as nationalists and purged from the party in the late 30s, revealing their
            biases the whole time and inappropriately taking advantage of Soviet state mechanisms for their
            own chauvinistic agenda. By then, however, the Karabakh question was considered settled, and
            no further changes were made. In the late 50s and 60s, there was a resurfacing of nationalism,
            and Azerbaijan fell again to misrule by chauvinists. Various laws and decrees were enforced
            against Armenians, while the same ones seemed to affect Azerbaijanis less. Infrastructure and
            industrial projects disproportionately benefitted the parts of the NKAO with Azerbaijani
            populations, and settlement programs that brought in settlers from Azerbaijan proper to
            Nagorno-Karabakh to change the demographics of certain areas were conducted. As a result,
            many disgruntled and alienated Karabakh Armenians left for Armenia, further consolidating
            Azerbaijani command over the NKAO.
            <br><br>
            Due to these injustices, various protests were organized and petitions signed across
            Armenia and Artsakh beginning in the late 60s. By the late 80s, organizations began
            consolidating with the purpose of unifying Armenia and Karabakh, the most well-known being
            the Pan-Armenian National Movement, with future Armenian president Levon Ter-Petrosyan (b.
            1945) as one of its leading board members. On 22 February 1988, the NKAO Supreme Council
            issued an official request to transfer to the Armenian SSR. Street clashes and beatings followed,
            particularly in Askeran, where two Azerbaijanis were killed. As a result, a premeditated pogrom
            with the involvement of local politicians and the police force targeting the Armenian population
            of Sumgayit erupted over a few days beginning on February 27. Arson, murder, robbery, and
            sexual assault were rampant, and Sumgayit’s 20,000 Armenians were expelled. To the great
            dismay of the Armenian population, in March, the Supreme Soviet rejected the NKAO’s request
            for transfer, adding further fuel to the discontent. Another pogrom of Armenians erupted in
            Ganja, where the 40,000 Armenians of the city and thousands more in the province were exiled
            by the end of 1988. Similar events unfolded in Baku in January 1990, where 150,000 Armenians
            were ultimately displaced. Thousands more would be deported to Armenia due to Operation
            Ring that following that spring, which was the final catalyst for the creation of Armenian irregular
            self-defense units against the special forces of the Azerbaijani SSR National Guard, OMON.
            Active firefights erupted as early as September, as did bombardments of the capital
            Stepanakert.

            declaration
            of independence of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR) on 2 September 1991, in fear of
            being targeted next by pogroms or deportations. Armenia confirmed their independence soon
            after through a referendum on 21 September 1991. As a result of the declaration of
            independence by the NKR, Azerbaijan dissolved its autonomous status; nevertheless, the NKR
            confirmed its independence on 10 December 1991, and Azerbaijan officially confirmed its
            independence at the dissolution of the USSR on 26 December. Fully-engaged warfare began
            immediately afterward.<br><br>
            Initially, only Stepanakert was soundly within Armenian control, condemning it to a brutal
            siege that lasted four to five months of starvation, indiscriminate shelling, and aerial
            bombardments, killing over a hundred civilians. The siege only received relief when Karabakh’s
            only airport, located in Khojaly, was captured in February 1992. Shushi was liberated on 9 May
            1992 by an offensive led by General Arkadi Ter-Tadevosyan (1939-2021), followed by the
            liberation of the Berdzor Corridor later that month, finally connecting Karabakh with Armenia.
            Over the next few years, Armenian forces ultimately consolidated most of the former NKAO
            under the NKR, and the war came to an end with an Armenian victory in 1994. In 2017, a new
            constitution confirmed the new name of the country as the Republic of Artsakh, though the
            Nagorno-Karabakh Republic also remains an official name.
            <br><br>
            Despite some border flares since 1994, no serious offensive against Artsakh was
            initiated until 2020. During then, over the course of 44 days, NATO-backed Azerbaijani forces
            occupied much of southern Karabakh, occupying Shushi on 8 November 2020. A hundred years
            following the 1920 Shushi Massacre, the Armenians of Shushi were once again expelled from
            the city.

            In the late 1980s, as the Soviet Union was collapsing, the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh voted to

            International involvement: The ceasefire agreement was brokered by Russia, and Russian peacekeeping forces
            have been deployed to the region to help maintain the ceasefire and ensure stability. The international
            community, including the United Nations, has also been involved in efforts to find a lasting solution to the
            conflict and to support the peace process.
            <br><br>
            Political situation: The Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, which was established during the first Nagorno-Karabakh
            War, is not recognized by any other country, and its future status is still the subject of ongoing
            negotiations and discussions.
            <br><br>
            Tensions remain: Despite the ceasefire agreement, tensions remain high between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and
            the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh remains complex and politically charged. The international community
            continues to work to find a lasting solution to the conflict and to support the peace process in the region.

            In summary, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh remains fluid, and the events surrounding the 2020

            However, the issue of self-determination and recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh is highly politically charged
            and is subject to multiple interpretations and conflicting views. Here are some arguments that have been
            made in favour of the recognition and self-determination of the Armenians in Artsakh:
            <br><br>
            1. Historical roots:
            The Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh has deep historical roots in the region, and many Armenians view
            Nagorno-Karabakh as part of their ancestral homeland.<br><br>
            2. Majority-Armenian population: Nagorno-Karabakh has a majority-Armenian population, which some argue
            provides a strong justification for the region's independence and recognition as a separate entity.
            <br><br>
            3. The right to self-determination: The right to self-determination is enshrined in the United Nations
            Charter and is considered a fundamental human right. Those who support the recognition and
            self-determination of the Armenians in Artsakh argue that this right should be respected and upheld.
            <br><br>
            4. The Nagorno-Karabakh War: The first Nagorno-Karabakh War, which took place in the late 1980s and early
            1990s, was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Those who support the recognition
            and self-determination of the Armenians in Artsakh argue that the war and the subsequent establishment of
            the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic provide a strong justification for the region's independence and recognition
            as a separate entity.
            <br><br>
            While these arguments provide a basis for the recognition and self-determination of the Armenians in
            Artsakh, the issue remains highly complex and politically charged, and there are many other factors and
            perspectives that must be taken into consideration. Ultimately, the question of recognition and
            self-determination in Nagorno-Karabakh is subject to ongoing negotiation and debate, and the future of the
            region remains uncertain.
